This is my answer for question 2 part III of my Taboola assessment.

III. Suggest changes that should be done in order to support any data type (as
opposed to only an int data type)

I think to support any data type would be easy as long as the data type was consistent in the entire tree.
With serializing to a String, having data in the form of Strings and Chars is already supported.

During the calling of the function we could pass through a String paramater called 'type' and write different functions that would cast the Data to tpye bool or array.
The code would have to be adjucted to pass in data structures like arrays or ArrayLists but all of these options would be relaively easy to implement.
